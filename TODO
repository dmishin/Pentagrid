TODO:

[+] Export image as PNG.
[+] Implement simple save and load for field. 
[+] "Day-Night" rules, that have B0 record.
   Normally, such rule can no be implemented, since they would produce infinite many alive cells after the first iteration.
   However, if rule has no BA, and no SA records, then after 2 iterations, all the cells that has became alive, will become dead again.
   Such rules can be replaced by 2 rules, applied sequentially,  
   	first rule: outputs inverted
   	second rule: inputs inverted.
   	
   	I.E. replace F -> F -> F ...
   	with F.I -> I.F -> F.I ... 
   	
   	where F is rule transfer function and I - inversion operation.
[] Export animation

[+] Implement offset matrix normalization (to prevent accumulating errors)
[+] Implement limiting view range
[-] Memoization of the transform getter: without much success


[] Create more decent GUI: buttons and menus instead of hotkeys
[+] Settings dialog: done, but very primitive
[+-] Add more settigns
  [] Set up colors
[] Make settings persistent
[] Add help (now only README available)

[+] Save rule with field
[] Export and import field in some well-defined format
[+] Better file chooser dialogs: default file types and better title

[+] Unlimited navigation
[ ]     When using unlimited navigation, show marks for the far-away cells.
[ ] Search groups of the cells
[ ]     Jump to the next cell group.  

[?] Automatically search and detect figures
